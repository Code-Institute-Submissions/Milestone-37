# Amstergram 
### The visitors guide to Amsterdams best!

The idea of Amstergram is for visitors to have a digital tour guide in their phone or laptop that they can 
quickly and easily refer to for ideas when visting Amsterdam. In this version I only included four pages of
catagorized locations but with the layout and template I created, many more catagories can quickly be added
for a more complete guide of Amsterdam.

# UX

There are a number of travel websites out there and whenever I go on vacation anywhere, I have to search through
multiple websites, read a ton of articles and scroll until my fingers are sore just to find the best cafes or popular
selfie spots in that city. 

While coming up with this idea my number one priority was to make it as user friendly as possible.
I didn't want users to have to read through long-winded articles containing opinions from people they've never met, I 
wanted to make sure they got the information they were looking for as painlessly as possible.

### User Stories:

*Generic User (traveller):*

* As a user, I want a guide to help me feel more like a local while on vacation.
* As a user, I do not want to read a ton of long boring articles.
* As a user, I would like this guide help me get to where I want to go in as few steps as possible.
* As a user, I would like access to maps.
* As a user, I would like to read short reviews written by other visitors.

For a generic user, Amstergram fulfills these goals by:

*Offering users only the best locations to visit while in Amsterdam.
*Providing a clean user interface not overloaded with useless text and design elements.
*Making the interface user friendly by organizing the catagories into separate pages making the website easy to navigate.
*Providing a clickable link to each locations Google map page which can provide travel directions and reviews.

*Developer*

* As a developer, I want to create a website that was fully functional and useful for people.
* As a developer, I want to create a website for my portfolio, showing off my creativity.
* As a developer, I want to create something that I would want to use myself.
* As a developer, I want to create something that I can expand upon as I continue to learn.

For myself as a developer, creating Amstergram assisted in fulfilling these goals by:

*Instead of creating a website for a fake product or make believe band, Amstergram is a project I can eventually launch.
*Being visually appealing and user friendly, Amstergram is something I would be proud to show people.
*Amstergram is a project I can continually add to and update as I see fit.

# Features

* The newsletter signup form will allow any traveller planning a trip to Amsterdam to recieve monthly updates 
on lists to help provide ideas for upcoming trips.

* Links to social accounts are available on all pages so users can see pictures and information relating to its content.

* Clickable menu icons quickly direct users where they want to go, making all content is easily locatable and user friendly.
 *By making the menu clickable icons vs. dropdown menu, I am easily able to expand the menu further keeping it user friendly.*
 
* A short synopsis and photo helps users decide if they want to explore each location further.

* Clickable buttons that direct users to each locations google map page provides directions and reviews making travel easier.

# Technologies Used

The technologies I used are:

* **HTML5** is the markup language used for rendering the website.

* **CSS3** is the style sheet language used to style the HTML website.

* **Bootstrap 4 Framework** for the mobile responsiveness and grid layout of the website. I also used Bootstrap's core CSS 
for some of the styling and layout, buttons and forms.

* **GitHub** used to host the deployed website and repository of all previous versions of the build.

* **Gitpod** was used as an online IDE to develope Astergram.

## Libraries Used

The libraries I used for this project are:

* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/6?next=%2F) for icons to use as links.

* [GoogleFonts] (https://fonts.google.com/) for the font used on all pages of the site.

# Testing

* I used the **HTML Validator** to check the markup on each page. No errors were found.

* The **CSS3 Validator** was used to check my CSS code for any errors. It came up with an error for the code used to
adjust the thickness of my text-decoration **(Value Error : text-decoration 3px is not a color value : underline 3px)**.
I tried to find another way to adjust the size but determined this is the way it's done.

* I ran through all buttons and links on Amstergram to make sure they were all working properly and linked to the proper
external websites.

* Tested the newsletter signup form by filling it out and making sure it submitted properly.

* Tested the site layout on larger screens, all the way up to 3800px. Some elements remained small so I added a media query
at 2500px and resized everything.

* Used Chrome devtools to test layout and sizing on small devices such as Iphones and Androids.

# Deployment

* I followed the directions on this [link from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) on how to deploy my project.

* The Amstergram deployed project can be found [here](https://ryanrayn.github.io/Milestone-1/index.html).

# Credits

* I used tutor support for help with a problem with Bootstrap Formatting. It was a weird issue that took awhile to solve
 but, a div on my menu was set to col-sm-6 which was not responding. After playing around with it we discovered col-6 worked
 in place of it.

* I used tutor support when I discovered that my elements weren't resizing onto larger screens 2500px+. The tutor said it
looked fine and shouldn't be a problem but I went in an added a media query to enlarge everything at 2500px anyway.

* Some of the pictures found for Amstergram were available for download on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). Others were either
taken by myself or found on Google images and were marked "free to use commercially".

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)  and [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) were also resources I used quite often to help solve coding problems.

## Special Thanks & Acknowledgements

* To the Code Institutes great tutor support who were always happy to help with any issues I encountered, they were all beyond friendly!
